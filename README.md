# MIPS-Assembler
## Implementation of the MIPS-Assembler in python
Simply, pass the code in assembly as a parameter to the function "assemble" and it will produce the output(Hex) in "program_file.txt" in the same directory as hulk. 
you can use the functions "hex_to_bin"/"bin_to_hex" to transform from HEX to BIN and vice versa.
